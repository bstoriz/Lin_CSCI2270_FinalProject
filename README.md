#Dragon Slayer#

##Project Summary##
	This is an text based rpg. It mainly consists of exploring dungeons, 
fighting monsters, and upgrading yourself. There's a leveling system where your
 health increases as you level. The fighting is basically rolling 6 sided dies,
 like old school table rpgs, but instead of 1-6 it's 1-5 so there's a chance of
 missing. This is not a hard game but more of an luck based game. The main way 
to navigate the menues are the numbers to the left of the option. I hope you 
have fun!

##Dependencies##
   - Locusts https://xkcd.com/797/
	This program shouldn't require anything but you should use Codeblocks 
and enable c++11 because that's the program I used to program this and c++11 
just to be safe.

##System Requirements##
	-20GB RAM(Graphics)

	Same as the Dependencies that this program shouldn't require anything,
but as a precaution, use the CU Boulder given VM.

##Open Issues/bugs##
